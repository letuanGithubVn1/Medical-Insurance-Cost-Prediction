# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
This project develops a linear regression model to predict individual health insurance expenses based on demographic and health-related behavioral factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and geographic region.

## 📊 Data Used
**🗂️ Data Source:** A CSV file containing sales on channels data
 
**📝 What's in the Dataset?**
It contains 1,338 entries with 7 columns:  
- age: Age of the insured person  
_ sex: Gender  
_ bmi: Body Mass Index  
_ children: Number of children  
_ smoker: Whether the person smokes  
_ region: Where they live  
_ charges: Insurance cost (this is what we’re trying to predict)

## 🎯 Main Objectives**
To explore the dataset and analyze the key factors influencing health insurance costs.
To develop a regression model for predicting individual medical insurance charges.

## ✅ Key Findings**
**🔍 Data Analysis Highlights:**
Smoking status is strongly associated with higher insurance costs.
Individuals with both high BMI and smoking habits tend to incur significantly higher charges.
There is a linear relationship between age and insurance expenses.

**📈 Model Implemented:** Linear Regression
